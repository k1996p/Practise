    <h3>Who is a <u>full stack developer</u>?</h3>
    <p style="border: 1px solid black;">
        A good full stack developer is like one of those celebrities who can do it all. They can act, sing, be a DJ,
        host a show, even direct, and produce! They may not have won an Oscar or a Grammy, but they still have the
        breadth of experience.

        They are capable of developing full-fledged applications (Web, mobile, or desktop). They understand both the
        front-end and back-end and know their way around servers, databases, APIs, MVC, and hosting environments among
        others.
